                     <h3>What is LMB Party?</h3>
                     <p>
                        LMB party is a traditional outdoors whole-weekend
                        lasting megaparty hapenning annually by the end of
                        april, placed outside civilisation within Karlstejn and
                        Beroun's surrounding areas.

                        We serve draft beer at the place for a reasonable coin,
                        some grilled food is sold at the place also. The
                        atmosphere of the event is backed up by loud reproduced
                        music, typically of Rock & Metal genres.

                     <h3>Directions</h3>
                     <p>
                        The place is reachable either by public transportation
                        (train, bus), or by a car. There is enough parking space
                        at the area of the event. The exact address of the place
                        is Tetín 70 (There is two types of house numbering


                        <a class="section_image" ><img src="images/picture2.jpg" width="240" height="214" alt="picture1"/></a>
                        there so there are also two seventies, look for the one
                        outside the village!).

                        Nearest villages & towns reachable by public
                        transportation are Tetín (1 km, bus from Beroun),
                        Srbsko (2km, train from Prague & Beroun), Beroun (3 km,
                        bus & train from Prague). In the case of arrival of a
                        larger group, we can arrange a car to help you with your
                        baggage.

                     <h3>Accomodation</h3>
                     <p>
                        Due to every year's increasing amount of attendees and
                        limited capacity of the object itself I am unfortunately
                        not able to provide an accomodation to all guests of the
                        party. Most of the beds inside are usually reserved

                        <a class="section_image"><img src="images/picture3.jpg" width="240" height="214" alt="picture1"/></a>
                        
                        for the LMB crew as a privilege and thanks for their
                        help. The rest of the places are usually taken pretty
                        fast, but you can take your chances. Most of the people
                        usually spend the night either in a tent or in their
                        cars. And some - of course - sleep wherever they fall
                        down.
